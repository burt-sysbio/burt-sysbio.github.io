Welcome to my website. I combine quantitative methods, machine learning and mathematical modeling to derive insights from data. My background in biophysics was shaped in a highly interdisciplinary environment at Humboldt University Berlin, University of Copenhagen and University of California, San Diego. I have several years of experience in scientific programming (python, R, JULIA) and have contributed to several research projects in the field of T cell immunology.
